# Frontend Mentor - Loopstudios landing page Challenge

![Design preview for the Loopstudios landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is my solution on the Loopstudios landing page challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenge. I build everything using only HTML5 and pure CSS3 without any CSS framework. To layout all the page, the flexbox technique is used entirely. Please leave me a feedback so that I can grow more. Thank you.
